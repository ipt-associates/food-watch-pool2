# FOOD WATCH (POOL 2)

http://food-watch-pool2.iptassociates.com/

IPT Associates LLC (IPT) used our Agile Vi™ methodology to quickly deliver Food Watch, our OpenFDA Minimum Viable Product (MVP) solution. IPT’s Agile Vi methodology blends the business and technical sides of IPT to form a wholly collaborative Agile enterprise, where iterative processes and continuous feedback loops enable us to quickly deliver customer-focused solutions. Agile Vi allows us to respond rapidly to shifting requirements, make decisions based on the tangible results we deliver, and remove the unnecessary unpredictability associated with traditional software development processes.  

The Food Watch prototype was delivered using the following Agile Vi process which is consistent with, and follows the U.S. Digital Services Playbook.

## Overall Development Methodology 

Food Watch is an example of IPT’s development process compressed into mini-sprints aligned to the original proposal deadline. In a typical development process, these sprints are usually two to three weeks, but for the purpose of this prototype we performed three two-day sprints to show the entirety of our process.  

Prior to Sprint 1, typical customer outreach occurs and a basic desire for a product is expressed. During IPT’s Sprint 1: Envisioning phase, the “Need Statement” that drives overall design and development process is garnered. Corporate leadership assigned Josh as Technical Architect and team leader who is ultimately responsible for project execution. 

## Sprint 1: Envisioning

This sprint is where we meet with the customer, review requirements and existing design assets, prepare our RDD (Requirements and Design Document) to ensure we understand the customer’s intentions and review with the customer for acceptance. 

### Sprint 1 Goal: *Customer vision delivered to IPT*. Activities Included:

* Met with customer to discuss vision and desired outcomes for OpenFDA initiative. 
* Developed a customer “Need Statement” as the underpinning for prototype development: Provide consumers with useful information based on the data made available through OpenFDA
* Defined user personas and began developing Use Cases  
* Decided on Food Watch as the solution name, briefly description tool
* Created an initial set of wireframes as a baseline
* Developed the Food Watch RDD product which is provided in the GitHub repository  

## Sprint 2: Development

Based on the RDD, one or more sprints are scheduled within a release window. A typical release usually contains two to four development sprints, with each sprint having at least one customer review session at the end, but typically we involve the customer as often as we can and find appropriate. 

### Sprint 2 Goal: *Develop the use cases into functional software*. Activities included: 

* Team identified a MVP based on the use cases: the Food Watch food recall exploration tool  
* Used the test scenarios to complete outcome driven testing
* Created a product style guide to establish a consistent Food Watch style
* Instantiated the solution technical architecture and deployed solution on Microsoft Azure Web App PaaS
* We chose a modern technology stack using 10 open source technologies (e.g. Durandal, Bootstrap, jQuery, .NET)
* Set up and used continuous integration to execute unit tests and deployed to isolated MS Azure Wep App container
* Set up and used configuration management in Visual Studio Online with GIT repository and continuous monitoring capabilities in Azure Web App
* Performed usability tests with users and incorporated feedback into iterative development 

## Sprint 3: Delivery Preparation

The final sprint before a release ensures that we have a quality feature set for the customer, and that any critical feedback the customer desires is incorporated into the release product. (If customer input is not feasible to implement, some feedback tasks move to the next release iteration.) This sprint is also where release notes/install guides/packages for release are finalized if required. 

### Sprint 3 Goal: *Deliver a working prototype that satisfies the customer vision*. Activities include:  
* Ensured prototype worked on multiple devices (IE, Google Chrome, iOS, Android) mobile and presented a responsive design 
* Created installation guide 
* Held final internal review to ensure release goals were met 
* Held release post-mortem to ensure lessons learned are captured and used to inform the next release
